 # hstTreasury

This serves as the code distribution for the aperture and PSF photometry pipelines created for HST Treasury Program GO-14734.  

Currently, only the aperture photometry portion has been publicly shared. It does not include a dust correction at this time, so please apply your own.

The environment requirements text files contain the versions of packages that have been confirmed to work with the codes presented here. You may try to use updated versions of certain packages, but there is no guarantee that they will work. Please note that the drizzlepac version used here requires Python 3.7.

The PSF photometry and artificial star test scripts will be added following the submission of the data release paper, although some may be posted as time permits.
